# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project applies anomaly detection techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. It focuses on modeling rare events using unsupervised learning.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing and Scaling
- Anomaly Detection Models:
  - Isolation Forest
  - One-Class SVM
  - Autoencoder (Neural Network)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

## Outcome
Successfully identified anomalies in imbalanced datasets using multiple models, with visualizations and metric-based comparisons.
